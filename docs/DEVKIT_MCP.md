# RenoDX Devkit MCP

This guide covers the current RenoDX devkit and MCP workflow for inspecting a running game, dumping shaders, iterating on replacements, and validating HDR resource behavior.

## 1. What the pieces are

The live inspection stack has three parts:

1. the game-side `devkit` addon
2. the `renodx-mcp-bridge` process
3. an MCP client such as Codex or another JSON-RPC MCP host

The game addon exposes frame, shader, and resource inspection over a named pipe. The bridge exposes that pipe as an MCP tool server.

## 2. What to build

For live inspection and MCP-driven modding, build:

```powershell
cmake --preset clang-x64
cmake --build --preset clang-x64-debug --target devkit mcp_bridge
```

The debug artifacts are:

- `build/Debug/renodx-mcp-bridge.exe`
- `build/Debug/renodx-devkit.addon64`

The bridge advertises the DevKit tool surface up front. If there is exactly one live backend pipe, it auto-connects on first use. Otherwise use the bridge tools first:

- `renodx_list_connections`
- `renodx_connect`

## 3. Tool groups

The exact MCP schema can evolve, but the current workflow is built around these groups.

### Connection and frame state

- `renodx_list_connections`
- `renodx_connect`
- `devkit_status`
- `devkit_select_device`
- `devkit_queue_snapshot`
- `devkit_snapshot_summary`

### Frame inspection

- `devkit_list_shaders`
- `devkit_list_draws`
- `devkit_get_draw`
- `devkit_get_shader`

### Resource inspection

- `devkit_analyze_resource`
- `devkit_set_resource_clone`

### Shader dump and live iteration

- `devkit_dump_shader`
- `devkit_set_tools_path`
- `devkit_set_live_shader_path`
- `devkit_load_live_shaders`
- `devkit_unload_live_shaders`

## 4. Recommended investigation loop

For a new game, work backward from the end of the frame.

1. Connect and choose the active device.
2. Queue a snapshot and wait for the next present.
3. Inspect late draws first.
4. Identify the likely scene composite, UI, and final blit stages.
5. Inspect the candidate draw with `devkit_get_draw`.
6. Read back the relevant resources with `devkit_analyze_resource`.
7. Only after the target pass is clear, dump and edit shaders.

This usually answers the important question first:

- is HDR already gone before the final blit
- or is the final blit still carrying recoverable scene data

Do not start from the first bright shader you find. Start from the latest pass that still has scene HDR potential.

## 5. Choosing the right device

Many games expose multiple D3D devices. Only one may be the active renderer.

Check `devkit_status` and `devkit_select_device` before analyzing anything:

- active swapchains
- pipeline counts
- tracked shaders
- captured draws

If one device shows `0` draws or `0` tracked shaders, it is usually not the one you want.

## 6. Reading frame structure

Use `devkit_list_draws` to find likely late-frame candidates, then `devkit_get_draw` for the exact pass.

The useful fields are:

- pixel and vertex shader hashes
- render target view details and format
- SRV inputs and format
- blend state
- swapchain and clone flags

For HDR work, the most important draw categories are:

- the last scene composite or tonemap pass
- later SDR UI and text passes
- the actual final copy or swapchain pass

If the final pass is only a one-texture blit from an already SDR target, it is not the place to recover HDR.

## 7. Shader inspection and dumping

`devkit_get_shader` returns metadata plus optional disassembly or decompilation text over MCP. It does not send raw shader bytecode by default.

If the game ships its own `dxcompiler.dll` or other conflicting shader tools, point `devkit_set_tools_path` at the repo `bin` directory first so devkit loads the repo toolchain instead of the game-local copy.

Use `devkit_dump_shader` when you want the original compiled shader on disk.

Important rule:

- dump original `.cso` files outside `src/games/**`

Do not place dumped `.cso` files in your live shader folder. If both a dumped binary and an editable HLSL replacement exist for the same hash, the binary can shadow the editable source.

Recommended layout:

- originals: `tmp/{game}/original/`
- editable live replacements: `src/games/{game}/`

For dumped DXBC shaders, the repo-standard external decompiler is:

- `bin/cmd_Decompiler.exe`

If it is missing, bootstrap the repo tools from the repo root before using the decompiler:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup-dev-env.ps1 -Install
```

That installs `cmd_Decompiler.exe` into `.\bin`. For the full tool bootstrap and the remaining optional reverse-engineering binaries, see `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Devkit MCP can already disassemble tracked DirectX shaders. Decompilation is best-effort and currently uses the DXC path, so it may be unavailable for some older DXBC-era shaders even when the tools path is configured correctly. The external tools in `.\bin` are still useful when you want standalone files on disk or alternate reverse-engineering workflows.

Example:

```powershell
bin\cmd_Decompiler.exe --decompile tmp\road96\original\0x1561F9BA.cso
```

## 8. Live shader iteration

The safe loop is:

1. dump original shader to `tmp`
2. decompile it when available, or fall back to disassembly / external tools
3. copy the editable HLSL into `src/games/{game}`
4. point `devkit_set_tools_path` at your repo `bin` folder if the game has conflicting DXC DLLs
5. point `devkit_set_live_shader_path` at that folder
6. call `devkit_load_live_shaders`
7. verify with `devkit_get_shader` that the source is `File`

Keep the live shader folder clean:

- only editable HLSL replacements
- no dumped `.cso`
- no unrelated experiment artifacts

When editing a dumped shader:

- preserve the original register bindings
- keep the vanilla logic visible in comments if you are testing an HDR change
- do not silently delete the original behavior when you still need an SDR reference

## 9. Resource cloning and HDR validation

Resource cloning is often the fastest way to prove whether a scene path can carry HDR.

Important distinction:

- the original view may still be `r8g8b8a8_unorm_srgb`
- the clone can be `r16g16b16a16_float`

That means:

- the original view can look clipped
- the clone can still hold values above `1.0`

Use `devkit_set_resource_clone` to enable cloning, then analyze the same resource with:

- the original view
- `preferClone: true`

This is the authoritative way to answer whether the upgraded path is actually preserving HDR data.

## 10. Dump formats

`devkit_analyze_resource` can write both preview and HDR-preserving outputs.

- `.png`
  SDR preview only
- `.exr`
  HDR-preserving `RGBA16F` dump

Do not use the PNG alone to decide whether HDR survived. Use:

- the numeric analysis
- the EXR dump
- or the clone readback stats

The PNG is for quick visual inspection, not for HDR truth.

## 11. Current practical caveats

- Some clone and preview workflows may still behave better when the devkit overlay has already touched the resource in the current session. Treat that as a devkit limitation, not as a mod requirement.
- If a game stalls during live shader reload, rebuild the latest devkit. Live shader load and unload are designed to be queued and processed on present, not on the MCP thread.
- Shader decompilation is not guaranteed for every tracked DirectX shader. If `devkit_get_shader` reports the decompilation section as unavailable, use disassembly or a dumped shader with external tools instead.
- If an MCP client loses its transport, that does not necessarily mean the game-side devkit backend is gone. Reconnect the bridge and check `devkit_status`.

## 12. What to turn into a real mod

Devkit MCP is for narrowing the problem and proving a path. The shipping mod should then move the proven behavior into `src/games/{gamename}`:

- `addon.cpp` for resource upgrades and shader registration
- CRC-addressed shader replacements
- manual verification notes

Do not ship a mod that still depends on manual devkit clone toggles or the overlay being open.

The usual progression is:

1. prove the target pass with MCP
2. prove HDR survival with clone readback
3. convert the successful path into addon logic
4. validate the real non-devkit path

## 13. Client configuration examples

These examples assume you built the local debug bridge at:

- `C:\Mods\renodx\build\Debug\renodx-mcp-bridge.exe`

### Codex

Add this to `.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.renodx]
command = "C:\\Mods\\renodx\\build\\Debug\\renodx-mcp-bridge.exe"
args = []
```

Typical first prompt:

```text
Use the RenoDX MCP bridge. List the available DevKit connections, connect if needed, queue a snapshot on the active device, then show me the last 10 draws and the first 10 tracked shaders.
```

### Claude Desktop

Add this to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "renodx": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "C:\\Mods\\renodx\\build\\Debug\\renodx-mcp-bridge.exe",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code / Copilot Chat

Add this to `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "renodx": {
      "command": "C:\\Mods\\renodx\\build\\Debug\\renodx-mcp-bridge.exe",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- VS Code can also keep the same MCP server config in user `settings.json` instead of a workspace `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- GitHub-hosted Copilot coding agent is not a good fit for this bridge. `renodx-mcp-bridge.exe` is a local Windows process that expects a running game and DevKit addon on the same machine.
